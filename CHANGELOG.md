- 815a211: add anime tracking page (#134)
  - This PR introduces the **Anime List** feature #133 , integrating AniList API to fetch and display my personal anime tracking data under `/about/anime`. It also includes a new API endpoint (`GET /api/anime`) to handle data retrieval. The header menu now highlights the current page dynamically, improving navigation clarity. Additionally, I refactored the scroll progress bar into its own component (`ScrollPositionBar.tsx`) for better maintainability. Fixed an issue where the scroll bar was hidden behind headers. The overall UI/UX could use some refinement, especially for submenu interactions and hover effects on different devices. Also, styling details need to be revisited to better align with the rest of the site.
